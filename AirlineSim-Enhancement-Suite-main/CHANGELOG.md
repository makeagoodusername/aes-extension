# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.7.8] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- Added release notes dialogs for new versions, including a footer version link that reopens the notes on demand.
- Added support for grouped inventory tables so AES analysis can read `Group by flight` layouts without forcing players back to the classic table.
- Added an opt-in Inventory Pricing setting for reference recommendations when the current route price has no finished or inflight results yet.

### Changed

- Refined the release notes dialog styling so it adapts cleanly to dark, classic, and light AirlineSim themes, and now shows the release date next to the AES version.
- Updated Inventory Pricing analysis to separate executable recommendations from reference recommendations, merged `New Price` into the recommendation text, and right-aligned the load column for clearer reading.
- Updated the installation guide to prioritize the Chrome Web Store release.

### Fixed

- Fixed Inventory Pricing so route analysis distinguishes between missing passenger capacity and true zero-passenger results on Route Management pages.
- Fixed Inventory Pricing so settings toggles such as automatic price updates and automatic tab closing are no longer overwritten by stale settings snapshots from other pages.
- Fixed grouped Inventory Pricing edge cases where invalid historical fallbacks could show `0` as the analysis price.
- Fixed Inventory Pricing so AES reloads automatically after toggling `Group by flight`, without requiring a full page refresh.
- Fixed the options page status message handling for the jQuery slim build that does not support `fadeOut()`.
- Fixed several DOM construction and parsing issues highlighted by static analysis, including release note rendering and documentation example syntax.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-04-13

### Changed

- Refined Dashboard loading, filtering, and schedule table behavior so each tab restores more cleanly and large datasets feel steadier while data loads.
- Improved the Flights page HUB override controls layout so the AES tools sit more naturally within the native aircraft Flights page.

### Fixed

- Fixed Dashboard tab initialization, filter normalization, and competitor schedule rendering issues that could leave tabs blank or throw runtime errors until filters were reapplied.
- Fixed Dashboard sorting, zero-value rendering, and Aircraft Profitability row actions so formatted numbers sort correctly, valid `0` values remain visible, and undelivered aircraft can still be managed safely.
- Fixed Fleet Management filtering and native selection link integration so `all / none / invert` works with AES filters, action availability stays in sync with checkbox state, and native table refreshes no longer break AES-added columns.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Added richer Fleet Management extraction for delivery status, ownership, pilot assignment, seat configuration, and schedule state.
- Added automatic aircraft HUB detection from the Flights page, plus HUB override controls and Fleet Management HUB filtering.
- Added new Aircraft Profitability columns for delivery status, ownership, pilot assignment, seat totals, pure cargo status, seat configuration, schedule state, and HUB.

### Changed

- Refined the aircraft Flights page tools so the AES controls sit more naturally inside the original page layout and use notifications for status feedback.
- Updated Fleet Management terminology from `Equipment` to `Model`, added a HUB column, and aligned new table headers with the native fleet table styling.
- Renamed Aircraft Profitability schedule labels to `Active`, `Locked`, `Conflict`, and `Empty`, with matching status colors.

### Fixed

- Fixed Fleet Management extraction on live pages where aircraft links use relative paths, restoring aircraft ID capture and downstream fleet persistence.
- Fixed Fleet Management and Dashboard handling for undelivered aircraft so they can be stored by registration before an aircraft ID exists and still display the correct `Delivered` status.
- Fixed HUB synchronization so data extracted on the Flights page is available in Fleet Management and Aircraft Profitability.
- Fixed the Flights page notifications so they auto-dismiss again after a short delay.
- Fixed Fleet and Flights table presentation issues, including undelivered aircraft profit/date alignment, header centering, and missing border artifacts.

## [0.7.5] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- Added Dashboard filters for Competitor Monitoring, including substring matching for text fields.
- Added additional Competitor Monitoring facts and figures extraction for operated flights, seats offered, seat kilometer offered, units offered, and freight kilometer offered.
- Added local release and Chrome Web Store preparation materials, including a packaging script, privacy policy, and store listing draft.

### Changed

- Refactored Dashboard tables to share one rendering and control architecture across Route Management, Competitor Monitoring, and Aircraft Profitability.
- Moved Competitor Monitoring row actions into the shared Dashboard action toolbar and aligned Dashboard action button order across Route Management and Aircraft Profitability.
- Improved Dashboard filtering and aggregate behavior so filters, column toggles, and Aircraft Profitability averages stay in sync with the visible table state.

### Removed

- Removed an unused extension permission to reduce Chrome Web Store review scope.

### Fixed

- Fixed Dashboard column chooser panels so Competitor Monitoring and Aircraft Profitability stay open while multiple columns are toggled.
- Fixed Competitor Monitoring controls so the filter panel also appears when no competitors are currently tracked.
- Improved Dashboard Competitor Monitoring loading by indexing tracked competitors per controlled airline and loading only their schedule data.
- Fixed Fleet Management so updating aircraft data no longer creates a phantom aircraft entry when the default fleet is empty. [#29](https://github.com/NEWLY2014/AirlineSim-Enhancement-Suite/issues/29)
- Fixed reported Inventory and Dashboard runtime errors caused by missing page elements or unavailable storage references. [#4](https://github.com/NEWLY2014/AirlineSim-Enhancement-Suite/issues/4) [#5](https://github.com/NEWLY2014/AirlineSim-Enhancement-Suite/issues/5) [#6](https://github.com/NEWLY2014/AirlineSim-Enhancement-Suite/issues/6)
- Fixed Aircraft Profitability age aggregation so age is averaged in the summary row instead of summed. [#9](https://github.com/NEWLY2014/AirlineSim-Enhancement-Suite/issues/9)
- Fixed source archive hygiene so development-only repository files are excluded from generated archives.
- Fixed Manifest V3 compliance issues by removing remote stylesheets from extension pages and replacing deprecated `ShowPageAction` usage.
- Fixed Competitor Monitoring so each controlled airline has its own competitor list instead of sharing one server-wide list.
- Fixed old data cleanup so storage dates in `YYYYMMDD` format are parsed correctly and recent history is not removed by mistake.
- Fixed settings initialization so existing users receive newly added default settings after an update.
- Fixed airline detection to avoid storing data under an empty airline key when the current page lacks expected airline details.
- Fixed notifications initialization so pages without the expected navbar container no longer fail when creating the notification panel.
